###DOCUMENTATION

**A. Installation**
 
 Before using this, make sure you have installed Meteor >= 0.9.1. 

 To install meteor, run this command:

 ```
 curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
 ```

 After that, follow these instructions:
 
 1. Git clone or download this repo:
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/radiegtya/meteoris.git myproject
 ```
 
 2. Change dir to your apps then just run:
 
 ```
 meteor
 ```
 
 3. Then type ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser to open the demonstration app.
 
 
 4. Register your account from the registration page, then  loging in using that account. You can then use the demo CRUDSS app at:
```
	http://localhost:3000/posts/index
```

5. You can also using code generator (mugen) from this link
```
	http://localhost:3000/mugen (for more info about how to use it, please take a look at the demo video)
```

**B. Folder Structure**

```
client/ 				# Client folder
    assets/             # Packages with global variable
    configs/            # Configuration files on the client

```

**C0. mugen -- the Meteoris generator**

NOTE: This documentation added by ssteinerX.  The really cool thing that Meteoris does wasn't mentioned in the original README.md file though it is shown in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erZvEQkr8kw).

Now, for what Meteoris does that's cool...

Go to:
```
	http://localhost:3000/mugen
```

This is the Meteoris UI Generator.  It will generate a complete(ish) set of files for a new model, just by entering the field information and pressing the "Submit" button.  NOTE: I've renamed it "Generate" in my repository, because that's what it does.

**NOTE:** as of Meteoris v0.9.4, there is a bug where, after adding a field, a new, blank field is created.  You **MUST** delete the blank field as the generator will otherwise create code that will not only not work, but will crash your app until you either manually delete all the generated files, or go hunt down each generated bug (not recommended).

**NOTE:** ```mugen``` is **not** a two-way tool.  It generates the code, then forgets everything about your data structure.  An improvement, obviously, would be to store field data so as to be able to go back and regenerate the files with an updated data structure.

All the rest of section "C" tells how to do this manually, which you no longer have to do; all that code is generated by ```mugen```.

**C. Routing, Controller and Views**

*1. What is a Controller*

Controller classes are responsible for displaying dynamic data in the view.

*2. Creating a Controller (Backend)*

Let's create a simple controller named PostsController that extends MeteorisController.


```
PostsController = MeteorisController.extend({

});
```

save this file in ```lib/controllers/PostsController.js```

*3. Create functions inside Controller (Backend)*


```
Backend.PostsController = MeteorisController.extend({
	getOtherMessage: function(){
        return "my Name is Ega Wachid Radiegtya";
	},
	
	/* passing data from controllers to view */
    data: function() {
	    var otherMessage = this.getOtherMessage();
        return {
			helloWorld: "Hello World",        
			otherMessage: otherMessage,
        };
    },
});
```

save this file in ```lib/controllers/backend/PostsController.js```

The ```data``` function is responsible  for storing dynamic data to be displayed in the view. Create a view with related name, remember this is a best practice naming convention in Meteoris.

*4. Create an html page to be used with the Controller*


```
<template name="backendPostsIndex">
	<p>{{helloWorld}}</p>
	<p>{{otherMessage}}</p>
</template>
```

save this file in ```client/views/backend/posts/index.html```

*5. Set up your router* 

Router is responsible for url formatting, for example if you want to redirect user to "AppName/posts/index". You can make routing like this. 

> Best practice note: 
> - AppName is your apps name
> - posts is your controller name or your folder in views name
> -  index is your view name inside folder posts
> This is a little different from MVC concept that other frameworks use, where index is 
>  function name from the controller. It's Because we are using MVVM concept.


```
    /* POSTS */
    this.route('backendPostsIndex', { //targetted template
        path: 'backend/posts/index/', //desired path
        controller: Backend.PostsController, //targetted controller
    });
``` 

save this file in ```lib/router.js```

*6. Running your app*

To run your app, use this url ```http://localhost:3000/posts/index```

Now you should see "Hello World" and "my Name is Ega Wachid Radiegtya" message on your screen. Congratulation!
